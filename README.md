## Brain Even Game

In the ${\color{green}"Brain Even"}$ game, you are shown a random number and must answer:

- `yes` if the number is even.
- `no` if the number is odd.

You need to answer three questions correctly in a row to win. Any incorrect or invalid input (e.g., n) counts as a wrong answer.

## Brain GCD Game

In the "Brain GCD" game, you are shown two random numbers (e.g., `25 50`, `100 52`, `3 9`) and must provide their greatest common divisor (GCD). You need to answer three questions correctly in a row to win.

## Brain Progression Game

In the "Brain Progression" game, you are shown an arithmetic progression with one number replaced by .. (e.g., `5 7 9 11 13 .. 17 19 21 23`). You must determine the missing number. You need to answer three questions correctly in a row to win.

## Brain Prime Game

In the "Brain Prime" game, you are shown a random number (e.g., `7`, `15`, `11`) and must answer:

- `yes` if the number is prime.
- `no` if the number is not prime.

You need to answer three questions correctly in a row to win. Any incorrect or invalid input counts as a wrong answer.
